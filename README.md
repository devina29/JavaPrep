## Java Topics
1. Java syntax: Java has a specific syntax that needs to be understood. This includes statements, variables, data types, and methods.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java is an object-oriented programming language, so it is important to understand the basics of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

3. Control structures: Java has several control structures, including if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and switch statements. These structures allow you to control the flow of your program.

4. Arrays: Arrays are a collection of data that can be stored and manipulated in Java. It is important to understand how to create and use arrays.

5. Exception handling: Exception handling is important in Java because it allows you to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution.

6. Input and output: Java provides many ways to handle input and output, including the use of files, streams, and the console.

7. Collections: Collections are important in Java because they allow you to store and manipulate groups of objects. Some common collections in Java include lists, sets, and maps.

8. Basic algorithms: It is important to understand basic algorithms, such as sorting and searching, in Java.
 
 ## CONSTRUCTORS IN JAVA

1. What is a function ? A function or method is a code block that takes an argument as input and produces output.
2. Functions can take input and return output
3. Functions may not take input but produce output
4. Func may take input but produce no output
   <access modifier><return type><function name>(<Type variable holding the inpput> called arguments)
5. If a function does not return anything, the return type is void, and function body must not have return statement
